        <h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>
        <p>Mozart was born in Salzburg, Austria, and began his musical education at a young age under the tutelage of
            his father, Leopold Mozart. By the age of six, he was touring Europe with his family, performing for royalty
            and gaining a reputation as a child prodigy.</p>
        <p>As he grew older, Mozart continued to compose and perform music, but he struggled to establish a stable
            career. He moved to Vienna, Austria, in 1781 and began working as a freelance composer, but he often had
            difficulty finding patrons and financial support.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, Mozart continued to compose some of his most famous works in Vienna, including his
            last three symphonies and the opera <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>. He died in Vienna in 1791 at the age of 35,
            leaving behind a vast body of work that has become an enduring part of classical music.</p>
